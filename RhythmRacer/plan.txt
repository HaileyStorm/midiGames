Next session we'll ...

You remember how I started the session with a project overview that included an update and next steps, and key code pieces? Here's what I sent you (not including the code):

You've been helping me with a project. Here's a summary:

```
Project Structure:

racing_game/
│
├── main.py
├── game.py
├── car.py
├── track.py
├── midi_controller.py
├── graphics.py
├── sound.py
├── settings.py
└── assets/
    ├── images/
    └── sounds/

Outline/Plan:

1. Set up the basic game structure (1-2 messages)
   - Create main.py with game loop
   - Implement basic Pygame setup in game.py

2. Implement MIDI controller input (1-2 messages)
   - Create midi_controller.py to handle MIDI input
   - Map controls to game actions

3. Create the car and its movement (2-3 messages)
   - Implement car.py with basic car properties and movement
   - Integrate MIDI controls for steering, acceleration, and braking

4. Design and implement the track (2-3 messages)
   - Create track.py to generate and manage the race track
   - Implement basic collision detection

5. Add basic graphics (2-3 messages)
   - Implement graphics.py for rendering
   - Create simple sprites for the car and track
   - Add a basic GUI (speed, time, position)

6. Implement game logic (2-3 messages)
   - Add checkpoint system and scoring
   - Implement game modes (continuous and timed)
   - Create win/lose conditions

7. Add sound effects and music (1-2 messages)
   - Create sound.py to manage audio
   - Add basic sound effects for checkpoints, game over, acceleration, braking

8. Polish and refine (2-3 messages)
   - Implement a high score system
   - Add a start menu with mode and difficulty selection
   - Create game over / end of game screens
   - Balance game difficulty

9. (Optional) Implement additional features if time allows (2-3 messages)
   - Add power-ups (utilizing drum pads)
   - Implement obstacles
   - Create basic AI cars

End Goal:
A simple but functional racing game where the player controls a car using the MIDI controller. The game should feature a curved track, basic graphics, sound effects, and a scoring system based on lap times.

Key Points for Reusability/Flexibility:
1. Keep the MIDI input handling separate (midi_controller.py) so it can be easily adapted for other games.
2. Design the car and track classes to be easily extendable for future enhancements or different game types.
3. Use settings.py for game constants, making it easy to tweak parameters.
4. Create modular graphics and sound systems that can be reused in other projects.

This plan should allow us to create a basic but functional game within a couple of days, while also keeping the code organized and reusable for future projects. Let me know if you want to adjust anything in this plan before we start implementation.

---

Update:
We have completed steps 1-6 of the plan. The basic game structure, MIDI controller input, car movement, track implementation, basic graphics, and core game logic are now functional. We have implemented a checkpoint system, scoring mechanism, and two game modes (continuous and timed). The track features smooth curved lines with visible checkpoints, and the GUI displays relevant game information including speed, time, checkpoints, and score.

Next steps:
Proceed with step 7: Add sound effects and music. This will involve creating a sound.py file to manage audio, and adding basic sound effects for checkpoints, game over, acceleration, and braking. Following that, we'll move on to step 8 to polish the game with a high score system, start menu, and end game screens, as well as balancing difficulty.

And here are some of the key files or pieces of files (important methods etc.):

Please let me know if you need me to provide any additional files/methods/other context. Otherwise, let's proceed to step 7. As we work, always lean toward showing only new/changed code and context, rather than complete files.
