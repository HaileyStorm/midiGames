Outline/Plan:

1. Set up the basic game structure (1-2 messages)
   - Create main.py with game loop
   - Implement basic Pygame setup in game.py

2. Implement MIDI controller input (1-2 messages)
   - Create midi_controller.py to handle MIDI input
   - Map controls to game actions

3. Create the car and its movement (2-3 messages)
   - Implement car.py with basic car properties and movement
   - Integrate MIDI controls for steering, acceleration, and braking

4. Design and implement the track (2-3 messages)
   - Create track.py to generate and manage the race track
   - Implement basic collision detection

5. Add basic graphics (2-3 messages)
   - Implement graphics.py for rendering
   - Create simple sprites for the car and track
   - Add a basic GUI (speed, time, position)

6. Implement game logic (2-3 messages)
   - Add lap counting and timing
   - Implement win/lose conditions

7. Add sound effects and music (1-2 messages)
   - Create sound.py to manage audio
   - Add basic sound effects for acceleration, braking, collisions

8. Polish and refine (2-3 messages)
   - Improve graphics and animations
   - Balance game difficulty
   - Add a simple menu system

9. (Optional) Implement additional features if time allows (1-2 messages)
   - Add power-ups or obstacles
   - Implement a basic AI opponent

End Goal:
A simple but functional racing game where the player controls a car using the MIDI controller. The game should feature a curved track, basic graphics, sound effects, and a scoring system based on lap times.

Key Points for Reusability/Flexibility:
1. Keep the MIDI input handling separate (midi_controller.py) so it can be easily adapted for other games.
2. Design the car and track classes to be easily extendable for future enhancements or different game types.
3. Use settings.py for game constants, making it easy to tweak parameters.
4. Create modular graphics and sound systems that can be reused in other projects.

This plan should allow us to create a basic but functional game within a couple of days, while also keeping the code organized and reusable for future projects. Let me know if you want to adjust anything in this plan before we start implementation.
